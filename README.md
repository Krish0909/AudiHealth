# AudiHealth - Voice Pathology Detection

AudiHealth is a machine learning-based application designed to detect voice pathologies, specifically vocal polyp and laryngitis, using audio data. Leveraging the power of VGGish for feature extraction and a Liquid State Machine (LSM) model for classification, AudiHealth aims to provide early detection capabilities, potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Introduction

Voice pathologies, such as vocal polyp and laryngitis, can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Early detection is crucial, but it often faces challenges due to the complexity of voice analysis. AudiHealth addresses this by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to analyze audio data and detect these pathologies with high accuracy.

## Features

- **VGGish Feature Extraction**: Utilizes the VGGish model for extracting rich audio features.
- **Liquid State Machine (LSM) Model**: A custom model architecture for pathology detection.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes SMOTE for handling class imbalance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides detailed performance metrics for evaluation.
